# instantJS
instantJS is a JavaScript game engine designed to be easy to understand, without learning new programming systems or concepts.

The engine can be used to create simple arcade games, or more complex creations.

The original design of this engine was written when I was 12 years old and wanted a way to create web games quickly, so I made this.
It's pretty bad, but with recent updates it *is* usable.

There's no documentation, or plans to add any fancy stuff like particles, actual physics, or animation, but if people actually use this then I'll add that stuff.
